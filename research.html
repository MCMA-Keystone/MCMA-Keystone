<meta name="The Mani-Cretin Mathematics Association (MCMA)" content="The MCMA is an organization founded by Tata Li and Kevin Shi. It is sponsored and supported by the Academy of Cretins, Cretin Organization, Mani Organization, Mani University, and Giberland Philharmonic. MCMA hosts various mathematics activities to develop students' interest in mathematics as well as their mathematical problem-solving capabilities. These activities include (but are not limited to) contests such as the Mani-Cretin Mathematics Examination (MCME), the Mani-Cretin Open Mathematics Tournament (MCOMT), and Mani-Cretin Mathematics Talent Search.

        <h1><strong>Research and Projects</h1></strong>
        <h5>Welcome, curious wanderer! You may notice something funny with this page: it's filled with <em>blogposts</em>, not published, formal, professional-looking articles! It is perhaps true that we're not as professional as many research institutions, 
        however the main purpose is to make our projects and ideas easily understandable to everyone. Our wording and structure is informal, our text is colorful, and our posts contain no professional jargon. 
        </h5>
          <p></p>
        <h5>In addition to projects, some of the posts available here are summaries of our research, as well as future plans/goals. Sometimes, we will write about interesting research published by other people.</h3>
          <p></p>
        <h5>Final note for readers: We welcome (and strongly encourage) questions and comments from both experts and the general public. We will carefully consider all suggestions and give detailed responses to all questions during the MCMA's conferences.</h3>

            <p>The Providential Intermediate Mathematics Olympiad (PIMO) is an educational mock olympiad of similar difficulty to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad">USAJMO</a>, though not selective in nature.
