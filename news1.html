2 Assessment and Complaint Resolution Committee, The Regulatory Committee of ProvidentialScience, Finalized 5 Dec 2023\br
3 ----------BEGIN CONTENT----------\br
4 Recently, the committee received frequent complaints from specific users regarding\br
5 the unsatisfactory performance of the ProvidentialScience editorial committee,\br
6 especially regarding the lack of productivity and unreasonable protocols of the\br
7 ProvidentialScience official account. After conducting thorough investigation, the\br
8 committee has concluded that while the contents of the complaints are true, the\br
9 reported behavior is reasonable and suits ProvidentialScience's codes of conduct.\br
10 It is suggested that people who are dissatisfied with the current situation\br
11 should try to accept it, as meaningful change will be extremely unlikely, \br
12 especially for an organization providing free editorial and publication service.\br
